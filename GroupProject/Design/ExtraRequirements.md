## Extra Requirement Information

While we were going through the overall software engineering concepts and analyzing requirements. We figure out few requirements which are not directly impacting the functionality of App, but indirectly related. Hence following are the non-functional requirements, which we think should be included to support functionality:

- Availability: App need to be available and operational all the time.
- Code Quality: Quality of code need to be maintained. This will indirectly impact rework and reduces the cost in terms of time and money
- Scalability: App should be scalable enough to handle the increasing or decreasing workloads.
- Capacity: App should not crash or behave abnormally in case of increasing capacity and should reach by scaling-up.	
- Maintainability:  App should be easy to maintain in case of troubleshooting and bug fixing of existing code. Also should be open to accept new changes with less efforts.
- Usability: App should be user friendly and easy to understand and use.
- Performance: App should go through performance testing, in order to make sure, it is ready for high load and should fail in production.
