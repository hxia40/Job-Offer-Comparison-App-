**Hui Xia:**
As suggested by the assignment requirement, we have proposed various designs of the UML class diagram for this project, and then merged our designs in a group meeting. The UML class diagram designs proposed by the other group members (besides me) are similar, which is drawn based on the design model, and contains many software behaviors, and demonstrates all proposed pages of the app. They argue that it is more demonstrative to include purely executive classes and methods, such as the “AppManager” class, and the “onClick()” method, in the UML design.  On the other hand, I have drawn a UML based on domain model, which provides visual representation of the real-world classes, attributes, and relationships. That is, my UML design did not contain the purely executive classes and methods. After discussion, we agreed that using the design model her serves our purpose better, as it directly shows how to implement the domain model into the software. Thus, we merged our UML designs in the favor of the design model.
