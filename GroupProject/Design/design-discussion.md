As suggested by the assignment requirement, we have proposed various designs of the UML class diagram for this project, and then merged our designs in a group meeting. The UML class diagram designs proposed by the other group members (besides me) are similar, which is drawn based on the design model, and contains many software behaviors, and demonstrates all proposed pages of the app. They argue that it is more demonstrative to include purely executive classes and methods, such as the “AppManager” class, and the “onClick()” method, in the UML design.  On the other hand, I have drawn a UML based on domain model, which provides visual representation of the real-world classes, attributes, and relationships. That is, my UML design did not contain the purely executive classes and methods. After discussion, we agreed that using the design model her serves our purpose better, as it directly shows how to implement the domain model into the software. Thus, we merged our UML designs in the favor of the design model.

For the first phase of the project, all the members of our team worked on their own interpretation of the design as UML or design documentation. We collaborated on team meetings and chats to cross reference and combine the ideas to come up with the final deliverable. My approach to this phase was to focus on the requirements from the end user as well as system design perspective. For instance, although the low level requirements like removing a job offer from the application was not defined explicitly, that was taken into account to make the user journey more complete. Similarly, the requirement does not specify anything more than specifying the name of the company, but we decided that it would be a good idea to keep that as a subclass so that it can be scaled up and reused if required in the further iterations of the product. We also created subclasses for job location and job benefits in order to support reusability and segregation of features. After combining the ideas into the final UML document, we also discussed the approach to document the same in the best way to make the design clear to the reader.
