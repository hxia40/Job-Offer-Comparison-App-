# Design Information Document

In a constantly evolving and demanding job market many individuals can get overwhelmed with the information overload. This app can be used as a tool to help users compare many different job offers and to help them select the right choice. Who would know what the perfect job is better than the user? Knowing this we are allowing the user to tell us what aspects of a job make it ideal for them.
The app is composed of 5 separate pages specialized pages:
1.	Main Menu
2.	Current Job detail entry
3.	Job offer detail entry
4.	Job preference settings
5.	Job comparison, if they have pending job offers.


# Main Menu:

This page simply presents the available options to the user, those available options being (Current Job detail entry, Job offer detail entry, Job preference settings, Job comparison)
Current Job Detail Entry:
If the user already has an entry here then they go into edit mode, but if it is their first time then they create it from scratch. The user will be promoted to answer the following questions:
1.	Title
2.	Company
3.	Location
4.	Overall cost of living in the location
5.	Yearly salary
6.	Signing bonus
7.	Yearly bonus
8.	Retirement benefits
9.	Leave time 

The user can cancel at any time and choose to save their work, so they can come back to it or cancel what changes they were about to make. The user is taken right back to the main menu after filling in their information.


# Job offer detail entry:

The user is also able to enter job offers they have obtained. The user will be prompted to enter the same information as when they entered their current jobs details. The user is able to save or cancel their entry of information at any time. Some other features they will have access to is that they can decide to start entering a different job offer. Compare the offer they are viewing to their current job, or simply return to the main menu.
Job preference settings:
As the user is the expert on what matters to them, we are giving them as much say as possible in customizing what parts of a jobs package matters the most to them. They will be able to add custom weights to the following variables to emphasis importance:
1.	Yearly salary
2.	Signing bonus
3.	Yearly bonus
4.	Retirement benefits
5.	Leave time
This is of course optional, and defaults to treating all offer components as equal.


# Job Comparison:

As stated, before a user can only compare job offers if they have them. When a user is comparing their job offers, they will see each company name and location in descending order based on the preference they have stated prior. Their current job will be distinctly visible so they can see how it compares to their other opportunities in arrogate. 
While being able to see how all a userâ€™s offers compare, sometimes the user will want to take a closer look. They are able to select two specific jobs and do a more detailed comparison. Where they get to compare the following:
1.	Title
2.	Company
3.	Location
4.	Yearly salary
5.	Signing bonus 
6.	Yearly bonus 
7.	Retirement benefits 
8.	Leave time
The salary, signing bonus and yearly bonuses are adjusted for cost of living, to make it a fairer comparison for the user. When they have finished viewing this comparison, they may either see another comparison or return to the main menu.


Requirements 6-9 do not directly affect the design and do not need to be shown, meeting their requirements will vary based on implementation techniques and methods.
