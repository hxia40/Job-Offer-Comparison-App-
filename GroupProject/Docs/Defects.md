| 1  |  the "Compare Job offers" page is not yet connected with the database | HX  |   |   | |
| 2  |  the "Job offers" page does not show which job is the current job. |  HX | Zeke  |   | |
| 3  | the "current Job details" will not remember the user's input, which would be nice if it can (I can try to fix this if needed).   |  HX | Hui  |   | |
| 4. | in "job offers" page, the "cost of living index" blank can still be inputed. Is this design by purpose? I thought we want to calculate the cost of living index by the database.| HX |  | |
