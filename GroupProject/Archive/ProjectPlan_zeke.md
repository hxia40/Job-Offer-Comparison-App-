## 1 Introduction

In a constantly evolving and demanding job market many individuals can get overwhelmed with the information overload.
This app can be used as a tool to help users compare many different job offers and to help them select the right choice.
Who would know what the perfect job is better than the user? Knowing this we are allowing the user to tell us what aspects of a job make it ideal for them.
